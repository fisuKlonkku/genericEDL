ABOUT GENERIC EDL

The basic idea is to structure Edit Decision List into python objects. All objects are gathered in the edit object that can parse different EDL and XML types. This makes easier to transfer editing data between non-linear video editing software that can import and export some kind of textual presentation of the edit data.

At the moment I'm structuring the objects. Next step will be publisihng more objects and firs example EDL parser. This will happen in April 2011 and after that I'll be needing some help.

USAGE

In the beginning the objects will be accessed from python. Maybe some simple GUI will applied later on.

At the moment aTime is only usable class. aTime examples

>>> # init with float or int (meaning seconds)
>>> time=aTime(10)
>>> # return time as Smpte list
>>> print time.asSmpte('film', 1)
(0, 0, 10, 0.0)
>>> # return time as Smpte string
>>> print time.asSmpte('film',0, '::;')
00:00:10;00
>>> # return time as number of frames using 'PAL' fps
>>> print time.asFrames('PAL')
250.0
>>> # init as smpte
>>> time=aTime('10:10:11:21')
>>> # init as frames
>>> time=aTime('f1000')
